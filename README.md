# bustabit-scripts
Scripts I've used in the past for bustabit and forked sites

Starting off with quoting the default warnings from the "custom" script pages on the games:

> This strategy editor is in BETA mode, please exercise extreme caution and use exclusively at your own risk. No bets can or will be refunded in case of errors.

> Please note the strategy editor executes arbitrary javascript without a sandbox and as such, only use strategies from trusted sources, as they can be backdoored to lose all your money or have intentional exploitable weaknesses etc.

And my note:
> The script(s) here are either old scripts I've used in the past and stopped using for whatever reason (probably due to losing funds) or scripts I've played with, tested, concepts, etc.

> I do not make any claims about the safety of these scripts.  I do not recommend or suggest the use of these scripts without fully understanding what the scripts will do or what you may lose as a result of these scripts.  You are using these scripts at your own risk.  There are no promises, warranties, guarantees or anything with these scripts.

> If you understand and agree with the previous paragraph then you may copy, modify or use these scripts.

Each script will be placed in a directory dedicated to the script.  The directory should contain a document explaining the script.  If it doesn't, it means it's not complete yet.
